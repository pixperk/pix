**RizzlerDB** is a lightweight, high-performance Redis clone, built from the ground up in **Rust**. It focuses on low-level control, concurrency, and performance ‚Äî designed as both a Redis clone and a deep learning project.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Clients connect via raw TCP on port \`6379\`
- Each connection is handled asynchronously using **Tokio**
- Custom RESP protocol parser (hand-built, zero third-party dependencies)
- Shared in-memory state managed via \`Arc<Mutex<_>>\`
- Pluggable persistence layer using a \`Persister\` trait
  - Default: \`JsonPersister\` (writes to \`db.json\`)
- Boot-time disk hydration for restoring previous state
- Full Pub/Sub system using async channels

---

## ‚úÖ Features

### Core Infrastructure

- Asynchronous TCP server with Tokio
- Manual RESP protocol parser
- In-memory database with native Rust data structures
- Thread-safe concurrency using \`Arc<Mutex<_>>\`
- Key expiry and TTL with background workers
- Pluggable persistence with disk write support
- Real-time Pub/Sub broadcasting
- Boot-time state rehydration

---

#### String Operations
\`PING\`, \`ECHO\`, \`SET\`, \`GET\`, \`DEL\`, \`EXISTS\`, \`INCR\`, \`INCRBY\`, \`DECR\`, \`DECRBY\`

#### Expiry & TTL
\`EXPIRE\`, \`TTL\`, \`PERSIST\`

#### List Operations

#### Set Operations
\`SADD\`, \`SREM\`, \`SMEMBERS\`, \`SISMEMBER\`, \`SCARD\`

#### Hash Operations
\`HSET\`, \`HGET\`, \`HDEL\`, \`HKEYS\`, \`HVALS\`, \`HGETALL\`, \`HEXISTS\`, \`HLEN\`

#### Pub/Sub
\`PUBLISH\`, \`SUBSCRIBE\`

#### Miscellaneous
\`KEYS\` (supports basic pattern matching)

## üß™ Running Locally

Start the server:
\`\`\`bash
cargo run
\`\`\`

Use Redis CLI to interact:
\`\`\`bash
redis-cli -p 6379
\`\`\`

Example session:
\`\`\`redis
SET name gigachad
GET name
INCR counter
LPUSH queue task1
HSET user name yash
SUBSCRIBE news
PUBLISH news "backend villain strikes again"
\`\`\`

---

## üå± Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Pattern-based Pub/Sub, multi-channel support
- [ ] Config file support (custom ports, persistence toggles)
- [ ] Key eviction strategies (LRU, LFU)
- [ ] RDB-style memory snapshots
- [ ] Append-Only File (AOF) persistence

---

## üéØ Motivation

Redis is a foundational tool in modern backend systems. With Rust‚Äôs focus on memory safety and performance, this project was an opportunity to explore:

- Systems programming
- Network protocols
- Concurrency models
- Data persistence strategies

**RizzlerDB** is more than a clone ‚Äî it‚Äôs a backend engineer‚Äôs playground for mastering the core ideas behind real-time databases and async server design.
